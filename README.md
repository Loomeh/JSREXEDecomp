# JSREXEDecomp

This is an extraction and decompilation of the Jet Set Radio Executable.

During the process of this I learned some info:
- More code might be stored somewhere else on the PC.
- JSR was written in C. Hopefully making modding easy.


If you have found anything else or want to help please contact me on Discord (Loomeh#9419).

To download the code, click the "Code" dropdown menu and click "Download ZIP".


This was all done in Ghidra.
