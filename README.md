# JSREXEDisassembly
This is a disassembly of the Jet Set Radio Executable.

During the process of this I learned some info:
- More code might be stored somewhere else on the PC.


I'm currently trying to make an In-Game Time mod if you want to help please contact me on Discord (Loomeh#9419).


To download the code, click the "Code" dropdown menu and click "Download ZIP".


This was all done in IDA Freeware.
