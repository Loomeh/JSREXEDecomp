# JSREXEDisassembly
This is a disassembly of the Jet Set Radio Executable.

The ZIP contains an .asm (Assembly) file and an .i64 (IDA Project) file.

During the process of this I learned some info:
- More code might be stored somewhere else on the PC.


I'm currently trying to make an In-Game Time mod if you want to help please contact me on Discord (Loomeh#9419).


To download the code, click the "Code" dropdown menu and click "Download ZIP".

Or if you have git installed you can clone the repository with ``git clone https://github.com/Loomeh/JSREXEDisassembly``.


This was all done in IDA Freeware.

If you use this in any of your projects **please** credit me. It helps out =).
